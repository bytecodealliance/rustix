//! Unsafe `ioctl` API.
//!
//! Unix systems expose a number of `ioctl`'s. `ioctl`s have been adopted as a
//! general purpose system call for making calls into the kernel. In addition
//! to the wide variety of system calls that are included by default in the
//! kernel, many drivers expose their own `ioctl`'s for controlling their
//! behavior, some of which are proprietary. Therefore it is impossible to make
//! a safe interface for every `ioctl` call, as they all have wildly varying
//! semantics.
//!
//! This module provides an unsafe interface to write your own `ioctl` API. To
//! start, create a type that implements [`Ioctl`]. Then, pass it to [`ioctl`]
//! to make the `ioctl` call.

/// This crate exposes many other `ioctl` interfaces with safe and idiomatic

///
/// While [`Ioctl`] takes much of the unsafety out of `ioctl` calls, it is

/// `ioctl` call. The contents of the object represent the inputs to the

/// `as_ptr` method. In most cases, this involves either casting a number to a
/// pointer, or creating a pointer to the actual data. The latter case is
/// necessary for `ioctl` calls that modify userspace data.

///
/// This trait is unsafe to implement because it is impossible to guarantee
/// that the `ioctl` call is safe. The `ioctl` call may be proprietary, or it
/// may be unsafe to call in certain circumstances.
///
/// By implementing this trait, you guarantee that:
///
/// - The `ioctl` call expects the input provided by `as_ptr` and produces the
///   output as indicated by `output`.
/// - That `output_from_ptr` can safely take the pointer from `as_ptr` and cast
///   it to the correct type, *only* after the `ioctl` call.
/// - That `OPCODE` uniquely identifies the `ioctl` call.
/// - That, for whatever platforms you are targeting, the `ioctl` call is safe
///   to make.
/// - If `IS_MUTATING` is false, that no userspace data will be modified by the
///   `ioctl` call.
