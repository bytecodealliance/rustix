/// Functions which need access to libc internals are out of scope for rustix.
///
/// Most Rust programs have a libc present, and when a libc is present, it
/// expects to be the only thing in the process that can do certain operations.
/// For example, there can be only one `atexit` list in a process, only one
/// `pthread_atfork` list in a process, only one implementation of pthreads in
/// a process, and so on, and libc expects to own the one of each of those
/// things. And libc implementations may expect to be involved in signal
/// handling. So, these functions are believed to be out of scope for rustix.
/// This module contains an incomplete list of such functions.
///
/// It would be possible to make a rust library which provides safe or
/// ergonomic wrappers around these libc functions, however that is out of
/// scope for rustix itself.
///
/// If you would like to write a Rust program which does not use a libc, and
/// which does provide APIs for some of these functions, [Eyra] and [origin]
/// are two libraries which may be useful, and which provide public interfaces
/// for some of this functionality.
///
/// If you are otherwise writing Rust code which you know will not share a
/// process with a libc, perhaps because you are writing a libc or similar
/// yourself, rustix's codebase does include experimental implementations of
/// the primitives needed to implement most of these functions.
