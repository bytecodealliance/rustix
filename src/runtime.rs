//! Experimental low-level implementation details for libc-like runtime
//! libraries such as [Origin].
//!
//! ⚠ These are not normal functions. ⚠
//!
//!  - Some of the functions in this module cannot be used in a process which
//!    also has a libc present. This can be true even for functions that have
//!    the same name as a libc function that Rust code can use. Such functions
//!    are not marked `unsafe` (unless they are unsafe for other reasons), even
//!    though they invoke Undefined Behavior if called in a process which has a
//!    libc present.
//!
//!  - Some of the functions in this module don't behave exactly the same way
//!    as functions in libc with similar names. Sometimes information about the
//!    differences is included in the Linux documentation under “C
//!    library/kernel differences” sections. But not always.
//!
//!  - The safety requirements of the functions in this module are not fully
//!    documented.
//!
//!  - The API for these functions is not considered stable, and this module is
//!    `doc(hidden)`.
//!
//! ⚠ Caution is indicated. ⚠
//!
//! These functions are for implementing thread-local storage (TLS), managing
//! threads, loaded libraries, and other process-wide resources. Most of
//! `rustix` doesn't care about what other libraries are linked into the
//! program or what they're doing, but the features in this module generally
//! can only be used by one entity within a process.
//!
//! [Origin]: https://github.com/sunfishcode/origin#readme
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! This module is intended to be used for implementing a runtime library such
//! as libc. Use of these features for any other purpose is likely to create
//! serious problems.
