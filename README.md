`rustix` provides efficient memory-safe and [I/O-safe] wrappers to POSIX-like,
Unix-like, Linux, and Winsock syscall-like APIs, with configurable backends. It
uses Rust references, slices, and return values instead of raw pointers, and
[I/O safety types] instead of raw file descriptors, providing memory safety,
[I/O safety], and [provenance]. It uses `Result`s for reporting errors,
[`bitflags`] instead of bare integer flags, an [`Arg`] trait with optimizations
to efficiently accept any Rust string type, and several other efficient
conveniences.

`rustix` is low-level and, and while the `net` API supports [Windows Sockets 2]
(Winsock), the rest of the APIs do not support Windows; for higher-level and
more portable APIs built on this functionality, see the [`cap-std`], [`memfd`],
[`timerfd`], and [`io-streams`] crates, for example.

`rustix` currently has two backends available:

 * linux_raw, which uses raw Linux system calls and vDSO calls, and is
   supported on Linux on x86-64, x86, aarch64, riscv64gc, powerpc64le,
   arm (v5 onwards), mipsel, and mips64el, with stable, nightly, and 1.63 Rust.
    - By being implemented entirely in Rust, avoiding `libc`, `errno`, and pthread
      cancellation, and employing some specialized optimizations, most functions
      compile down to very efficient code, which can often be fully inlined into
      user code.
    - Most functions in `linux_raw` preserve memory, I/O safety, and pointer
      provenance all the way down to the syscalls.

 * libc, which uses the [`libc`] crate which provides bindings to native `libc`
   libraries on Unix-family platforms, and [`windows-sys`] for Winsock on
   Windows, and is portable to many OS's.

The linux_raw backend is enabled by default on platforms which support it. To
enable the libc backend instead, either enable the "use-libc" cargo feature, or
set the `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable to `--cfg=rustix_use_libc` when
building.

## Cargo features

The modules [`rustix::io`], [`rustix::buffer`], [`rustix::fd`],
[`rustix::ffi`], and [`rustix::ioctl`] are enabled by default. The rest of the
API modules are conditional with cargo feature flags.

## 64-bit Large File Support (LFS) and Year 2038 (y2038) support

`rustix` automatically uses 64-bit APIs when available, and avoids exposing
32-bit APIs that would have the year-2038 problem or fail to support large
files. For instance, `rustix::fstatvfs` calls `fstatvfs64`, and returns a
struct that's 64-bit even on 32-bit platforms.

## Similar crates

`rustix` is similar to [`nix`], [`simple_libc`], [`unix`], [`nc`], [`uapi`],
and [`rusl`]. `rustix` is architected for [I/O safety] with most APIs using
[`OwnedFd`] and [`AsFd`] to manipulate file descriptors rather than `File` or
even `c_int`, and supporting multiple backends so that it can use direct
syscalls while still being usable on all platforms `libc` supports. Like `nix`,
`rustix` has an optimized and flexible filename argument mechanism that allows
users to use a variety of string types, including non-UTF-8 string types.

[`relibc`] is a similar project which aims to be a full "libc", including
C-compatible interfaces and higher-level C/POSIX standard-library
functionality; `rustix` just aims to provide safe and idiomatic Rust interfaces
to low-level syscalls. `relibc` also doesn't tend to support features not
supported on Redox, such as `*at` functions like `openat`, which are important
features for `rustix`.

`rustix` has its own code for making direct syscalls, similar to the
[`syscall`], [`sc`], and [`scall`] crates, using the Rust `asm!` macro.
`rustix` can also use Linux's vDSO mechanism to optimize Linux `clock_gettime`
on all architectures, and all Linux system calls on x86. And `rustix`'s
syscalls report errors using an optimized `Errno` type.

`rustix`'s `*at` functions are similar to the [`openat`] crate, but `rustix`
provides them as free functions rather than associated functions of a `Dir`
type. `rustix`'s `CWD` constant exposes the special `AT_FDCWD` value in a safe
way, so users don't need to open `.` to get a current-directory handle.

`rustix`'s `openat2` function is similar to the [`openat2`] crate, but uses I/O
safety types rather than `RawFd`. `rustix` does not provide dynamic feature
detection, so users must handle the [`NOSYS`] error themselves.

`rustix`'s `termios` module is similar to the [`termios`] crate, but uses I/O
safety types rather than `RawFd`, and the flags parameters to functions such as
`tcsetattr` are `enum`s rather than bare integers. And, rustix calls its
`tcgetattr` function `tcgetattr`, rather than `Termios::from_fd`.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This crate currently works on the version of [Rust on Debian stable], which is
currently [Rust 1.63]. This policy may change in the future, in minor version
releases, so users using a fixed version of Rust should pin to a specific
version of this crate.

## Minimum Linux Version

On Linux platforms, rustix requires at least Linux 3.2. This is at most the
oldest Linux version supported by:
 - [any current Rust target], or
 - [kernel.org] at the time of rustix's [MSRV] release.
The specifics of this policy may change in the future, but we intend it to
always reflect “very old” Linux versions.
